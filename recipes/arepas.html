    <h3>Arepas are small grilled corn cakes and are native to Venezuela and Colombia.</h3>

    <p>They can be eaten plain or stuffed with meats, cheeses,
       beans and vegetables. Sugar can be added to create a sweet cake which can be used for dessert.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ cups milk</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups arepas flour (such as P.A.N.®)</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ cup unsalted butter, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
        <li>vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) package cooked chicken, shredded, or to taste</li>
        <li>½ (8 ounce) package Monterey Jack cheese, sliced, or to taste</li>
        <li>½ avocado, sliced, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol style="list-style: none;">
        <li>Step 1
            <p>Bring milk to a simmer in a pot. Remove from heat and stir in butter.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 2
            <p>Combine arepas flour, grated Monterey Jack cheese, kosher salt,
               and black pepper in a large bowl. Add the hot milk mixture and honey; stir until combined.
               Let mixture sit until milk is absorbed enough for a soft dough to form, 1 to 2 minutes. Dough will continue to stiffen.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 3
            <p>Form dough into 12 balls about 2 inches in diameter. Flatten between palms into 3 1/2- to 4-inch arepa patties about 1/3-inch thick.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 4
            <p>Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Fry 3 to 4 arepas at a time until lightly golden brown,
               about 3 minutes per side. Slice each arepa in half crosswise and stuff a portion of chicken, sliced Monterey Jack cheese,
               and avocado between the halves.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
